# What is Bitcoin Cash?


Bitcoin Cash is a global, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that allows value to be sent to anyone, anywhere in the world, without intermediaries. Bitcoin Cash is not controlled by any single entity and is instead secured permissionlessly by thousands of computers around the world dedicated to maintaining the network. 

Bitcoin Cash is decentralized so that no business, institution, or government can control it and no one can censor your payments. It is an alternative to government-controlled fiat currency that has been mismanaged and debased to an unprecedented degree. Bitcoin Cash maintains a diminishing minting schedule and will forever be capped at 21 million coins, ensuring a currency that is disinflationary rather than inflationary.

Bitcoin Cash offers anyone in the world the chance to enjoy financial sovereignty like never before.
